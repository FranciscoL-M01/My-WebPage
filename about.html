      <p class="paragraph">
        My name is Francisco Lopez-Morelos, I’m a student at the California
        State University of Long Beach and I’m looking to get my major in
        Computer Science. Something that interests me quite a lot right now is
        Front-end Web and Mobile App Development but as of right now, Web
        Development is my priority.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Throughout my time in school, I’ve learned many things and worked with
        programming languages like C++ and Python. However, in order to pursue
        Web Development I’ve learned HTML, CSS, and I’m currently learning
        JavaScript. I’m always trying to learn new things and I’ve been enjoying
        the process. My goal is to be able to confidently think, create, and
        launch websites and mobile applications on my own. I really enjoy the
        process of making something new along with the creativity that lets me
        add my own ideas to the project.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Something more about myself is that I really enjoy gaming, watching
        films, and watching sports. I enjoy watching soccer/football and my
        favorite team is FC Barcelona, although the team isn’t in one of its
        best moments right now.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I would like to say thank you for taking the time to navigate my website
        and learn a couple of things about myself. Feel free to look at
        everything on my website and don’t hesitate to reach out to me to
        collaborate, for feedback, or even to simply talk about programming.
        Please feel free to reach me at (562-481-4718 or
        franciscolopezmorelos@gmail.com). I’m looking forward to always learning
        and I’ll try to keep working towards improving my skills and growing in
        the web development and mobile app development field.
